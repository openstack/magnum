    Kubernetes cluster owner can now do CA cert rotate to re-generate CA of
    the cluster, service account keys and the certs of all nodes will
    be regenerated as well. Cluster user needs to get a new kubeconfig
    to access kubernetes API. This function is only supported by
    Fedora CoreOS driver.
