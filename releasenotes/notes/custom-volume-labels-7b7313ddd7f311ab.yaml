    Support for overriding boot volume type and size for volume based master
    and worker nodes. Allows user to use different storage types and sizes for
    master and minion nodes with new labels:

    - master_volume_size
    - master_volume_type
    - worker_volume_size
    - worker_volume_type

    If either master_volume_type or worker_volume_type is missing,
    boot_volume_type will be used instead. A random volume type from Cinder will
    be used if none of those options is set. In case of master_volume_size or
    worker_volume_size missing value for boot_volume_size is used. If neither
    is defined instances will not be volume based.
