    The Magnum service now allows enables policies (RBAC) new defaults
    and scope checks. These are controlled by the following (default) config
    options in ``magnum.conf`` file::

      [oslo_policy]
      enforce_new_defaults=False
      enforce_scope=False

    We will change the default to True in the following cycle.
    If you want to enable them then modify both values to True.
