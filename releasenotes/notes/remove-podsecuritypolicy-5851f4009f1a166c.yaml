    PodSecurityPolicy has been removed in Kubernetes v1.25 [1]. To allow Magnum
    to support Kubernetes v1.25 and above, PodSecurityPolicy Admission
    Controller has has been removed.

    This means that there is a behaviour change in Cluster Templates created
    after this change, where new Clusters with such Cluster Templates will not
    have PodSecurityPolicy. Please be aware of the subsequent impact on Helm
    Charts, etc.
