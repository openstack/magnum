The Container Infrastructure Management service codenamed (magnum) is an
OpenStack API service developed by the OpenStack Containers Team making
container orchestration engines (COE) such as Kubernetes
available as first class resources in OpenStack. Magnum uses
Heat to orchestrate an OS image which contains Docker and Kubernetes and
runs that image in either virtual machines or bare metal in a cluster
configuration.

This chapter assumes a working setup of OpenStack following `OpenStack
Installation Tutorial <https://docs.openstack.org/#install-guides>`_.
